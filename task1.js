/*
*Task-1
Take four parameters. Multiply the four numbers and then return the result

*Task-2
Take a number if the number is odd multiply it by 2 and return the result. If the number is even divide it by two and return the result.

*Task-3
Write a function called make_avg() which will take an array of integers and the size of that array and return the average of those values.

*Task-4
Write a function called count_zero() which will take a binary string (Binary string is a string which is consist of only 0 and 1) as parameter and count how many 0â€™s are there in that string.

*Task-5
Write a function called odd_even() which takes an integer value and tells whether this value is even or odd. If even return Even. If odd return Odd
